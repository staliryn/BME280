## Bosch BME280

All the informations below can be found on device's [Datasheet.](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/media/boschsensortec/downloads/datasheets/bst-bme280-ds002.pdf)


The BME280 is a combined digital humidity, pressure and temperature sensor based on proven sensing principles. 

## Project goals

Understand the I²C communication principles through a pratical embedded software.

## Interfaces

The BME280 supports the I²C and SPI digital interfaces. It acts as a slave for both protocols.
The I²C interface supports the standard,fast and high speed modes. The SPI interface supports both SPI mode '00' (CPOL = CPHA = '0') and mode '11' (CPOL = CPHA = '1') in 4-wire and 3-wire configuration.

## Project requirements

In this project we are going to use these tools:

* Hardware:\
NUCLEO STM32L476RG \
BME280 Module\
Logic analyzer

* Software:\
STM32CUBEIDE\
PulseView
